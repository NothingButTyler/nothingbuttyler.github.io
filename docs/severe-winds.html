    <h1>Severe Winds!</h1>
    <p>
        
        Today, December 17, 2025, it was a typical school day, but the announcements came on and my vice-principal was telling everyone that all grade levels (6, 7, and 8) will not be allowed to go to recess. The winds were at 50-60 miles per hour at the time, but before me and our 4th period class transitioned to 5th period, the winds got worse. 70-75 miles per hour! The announcements came on again and they changed the times so we can leave school early. 12:30 PM. I asked my mom (on mesaages) if me and my sister could leave early, and she was fine with it. We stayed in 5th period for about 7 minutes, and then we transitioned to lunch. Lunch was pretty good, but the winds kept getting worse. We stayed at lunch until 12:15 and then we skip 6th period and go to advisor. We were there for 10 minutes. Luckily for me, it was 8 minutes, because I got to hear my name get called on the announcements for the first time in public! Last time it was in private. Without the office noticing, I left the school acting like I found my mom, when really she parked up on a hill. I had to get across a busy street. And then I made it inside the car. My sister made it too eventually but she decided to wait until it was time since the front office didn't let her go. Later, we stopped at a local grocery store to get things just incase if the power actually did go out. We stayed home the rest of the day, and we kept an eye out for anything that will blow away from the wind.
        <br />For more information on the alerts, here is a city that is nearby where I live that has the same information:

    <h1>Updates</h1>
    <li><b>Around 1:40 PM to 3:50 PM:</b> the power kept flickering but it didn't fully shut down. My girlfriend's apartment had that happen too, but nothing is fully wrong yet.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>Around 4:20 PM:</b> someone who used to live behind us (they no longer live there), their tent fell and starting blowing toward the street, so we had to go outside in the 70 mph winds to strap it tight so it doesn't disappear.</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>5:07 PM:</b> I checked the weather and it is now 35° here. It is pretty cold. The winds finally died down! It is now 26 mph which isn't terrible!</li>
    <br />
    <li><b>5:23 PM:</b> While I was updating this page, the power flickered again. It hasn't been doing this for awhile, but now it's doing it again.</li>
